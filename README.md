# Movie-Recommender-System

This is a recommendation system which works on ``content based filtering`` method. A content based filtering system works on the basis of ``similarity`` of content a user likes, based on their previous action or feedback. ``Tags`` are created of similar objects. Tags are converted into ``vectors`` for finding similarity between 2 tags so that the model can find out two similar movies by using ``bag of words technique``. ``Cosine distance`` funtion is used to find distance between two vectors which eventually shows the similarity and let us recommend movies.

#To run this model -
Open the environment, install the required libraries and code -
streamlit run app.py

#Note - similarity.pkl file is missing because it could not be uploaded as its size is big. If anyone requires it, I can send them.
